== Objects

=== Concepts

Objects represent identifiable resources whose authoritative state is maintained exclusively by the **Controller**.

Interaction with Objects occurs indirectly via operational messages sent to the Controller: `CREATE_OBJECT`, `READ_OBJECT`, `UPDATE_OBJECT`, and `DESTROY_OBJECT`. These messages identify the target Object and contain structured payloads, typically using <<payload-unions, FlatBuffers Unions>>, to handle data specific to different Object types efficiently and safely.

Every Object instance has exactly one **owner**, which is the `client_id` of the client that successfully requested its creation. Ownership is a key aspect of the access control model, particularly for Applications.

When a client disconnects (explicitly via `DISCONNECT` or implicitly due to socket closure), the Controller MUST automatically destroy all Object instances currently owned by that client. Upon destruction, the Controller removes the Object's state and MUST notify relevant subscribers via an `OBJECT_UPDATED` message with `update_type=2` (destruction).

=== Object Identity

It is important to distinguish between:

Object Type:: Defines the kind of Object and implies its expected properties and behavior (e.g., `WINDOW`, `BUFFER`, `CURSOR`). Core Object Types are predefined by this protocol.
Object Instance:: A specific occurrence of an Object Type, identified by its unique `object_id`, holding its own state (property values). For example, Window `object_id=3` is an instance of the `WINDOW` Object Type.

Each Object instance is assigned a unique `object_id` (`uint32`) by the Controller upon creation. This ID is used in messages to refer to that specific Object instance. Object identity may also involve its type (see below) for certain operations.

=== Interaction Messages

Interacting with Objects follows a CRUD-like pattern using messages directed to the Controller.

.Message: `CREATE_OBJECT`
[%collapsible%open]
====
Requests the Controller to create a new Object instance of a specific type.

.Request
|===
| Name | Type | Description

|===

.Response
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `object_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* The ID of the Object whose properties are being returned. This MUST match the request's `object_id`.

<<err-InvalidMessage,Invalid Message>>:: The `filter` contained invalid Property IDs for the target object's type.
====

.Message: `UPDATE_OBJECT`
[%collapsible%open]
====
Requests the Controller to update properties of an existing Object instance.

.Request
|===

.Message: `DESTROY_OBJECT`
[%collapsible%open]
====
Requests the Controller to destroy an existing Object instance.

.Request
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `object_id`
| `uint32`

.Response
|===
^| _Empty Body_
|===

.Errors
<<err-Unauthorized,Unauthorized>>:: Client lacks permission to destroy this Object.
<<err-NotFound,Not Found>>:: Object with `object_id` does not exist.
====

When a client disconnects (explicitly via a `DISCONNECT` message or implicitly via socket closure), the Controller MUST automatically destroy all Object instances currently owned by that client.

Upon destruction, the Controller removes the Object's state and MUST notify relevant subscribers via an `OBJECT_UPDATED` message with `update_type=2`.

[[permissions-objects]]
=== Permissions

Access control for Akari Objects is determined by the requesting client's role (`APPLICATION` or `MANAGER`) and Object ownership. The following table summarizes the permissions for core Object operations:

.Object Access Control
|===
| Operation | `APPLICATION` (Owner) | `APPLICATION` (Not Owner) | `MANAGER` | Notes

| `READ_OBJECT`
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
| All clients can read metadata of any object.

| `UPDATE_OBJECT`
| Yes
| No
| Yes
| Applications can only update objects they own. Managers can update any object.

| `DESTROY_OBJECT`
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
| Applications can destroy objects they own. Managers can destroy any object.

| `CREATE_OBJECT`
| Yes
| N/A
| Yes
| Any client may request object creation. Controller MAY restrict creation of certain `ObjectType`s (e.g., <<obj-Output, `Output`>>s) to `MANAGER` clients only (resulting in <<err-Unauthorized, `Unauthorized`>> for an Application).

| `SUBSCRIBE`
| Yes
| Yes
| Yes
| Permission to subscribe is implicit if the client can read the object(s); thus, all clients can subscribe.
|===

[[object-subscriptions]]
=== Subscriptions

To monitor Object state changes efficiently without polling, clients use Akari's publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) mechanism.

Clients can subscribe to changes on specific object instances or all instances of a specific core Object type. When a relevant change occurs (and matches the subscription's filter, if any), the Controller sends notifications containing only the modified data (the delta) to subscribed clients.

.Message: `SUBSCRIBE`
[%collapsible%open]
====
Requests the Controller to create a new subscription for monitoring object state changes.

.Request
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `object_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* ID of the specific Object instance to subscribe to. Set to `0` to subscribe to all Objects of the specified `object_type`.

| `object_type`
| <<enum-ObjectType, `Optional<ObjectType>`>>
| The type of objects to subscribe to when `object_id` is `0`. This field MUST be present if `object_id` is `0`. It MUST be ignored if `object_id` is non-zero.

| `filter`
| `Optional<uint16[]>`
| An optional list of specific <<enum-PropertyID, Property IDs>> to receive updates for. If absent or empty, updates for all property changes of the subscribed Object(s) are sent. If present, only changes to properties corresponding to the valid IDs in this list will trigger an `OBJECT_UPDATED` message. See <<property-filters>>.
|===

.Response
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `subscription_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* A unique identifier assigned by the Controller for this specific subscription instance. This ID is needed to unsubscribe later.
|===

.Errors
<<err-NotFound,Not Found>>:: Specified `object_id` (if > 0) or `object_type` does not exist. Or, if `object_id` is `0` and the specified `object_type` is not a recognized type.
<<err-InvalidMessage,Invalid Message>>:: Invalid combination of parameters (e.g., `object_id=0` and no `object_type` provided, or `filter` contains invalid Property IDs for the target object type).
====

.Message: `UNSUBSCRIBE`
[%collapsible%open]
====
Cancels an existing subscription.

.Request
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `subscription_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* THe ID of the subscription to cancel, previously returned by a `SUBSCRIBE` reply.
|===

.Response
|===
^| _Empty Body_
|===

.Errors
<<err-NotFound,Not Found>>:: `subscription_id` does not exist or is not active for this client.
====

Subscriptions MUST be cancelled and cleaned up by the Controller when a client disconnects.

=== Updates

When a Controller processes the creation/update/destruction of an Object, it checks for active subscriptions that match that Object and whose filter (if any) includes the changes. For each matching subscription, the Controller sends an `OBJECT_UPDATED` message to the subscribed client(s). This message requires no reply from the client.

.Message: `OBJECT_UPDATED`
|===
| Name | Type | Description

| `subscription_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* Identifies the subscription that triggered this message.

| `object_id`
| `uint32`
| *Required:* Identifies the Object that was updated or destroyed.

| `object_type`
| <<enum-ObjectType, `objectType`>>
| *Required:* The type of Object identified by `object_id`.

| `update_type`
| `uint8`
| *Required:* The type of Object update: (0=Creation, 1=Modification, 2=Destruction)

| `delta`
| <<schema-PartialObjectType, `Optional<PartialObjectType>`>>
| A FlatBuffers Union containing the specified changed properties.
    For `update_type=0` (Creation), this field MUST be present and contain the initial full properties of the object (respecting the subscription filter).
    For `update_type=1` (Modification), this field MUST be present and contain only the properties that changed (respecting the subscription filter).
    For `update_type=2` (Destruction), this field MUST be absent.
|===

=== Property Filters

Clients MAY filter the properties returned in `READ_OBJECT` responses and `OBJECT_UPDATED` notifications by using the optional `filter` field in `READ_OBJECT` and `SUBSCRIBE` requests. This field takes a list of <<enum-PropertyID,Property IDs>>.

When the Controller is processing a request containing a filter, the Controller MUST validate that every ID in the provided list is a valid, defined Property ID for the specified `object_type`. If any ID is invalid, the Controller MUST reject the entire request with an <<err-InvalidMessage,Invalid Message>> error. The Controller MUST NOT ignore invalid IDs.

If validation passes, the Controller uses the provided list to filter results. If the list is absent or empty, no filtering occurs.

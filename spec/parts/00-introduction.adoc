== Abstract

This document specifies Akari, a protocol for building Linux display systems based on a highly modular, component-based architecture. The primary goal is to provide a flexible and independent foundation for graphical sessions by enabling clearly defined and interchangeable core components.

== Introduction

Modern Linux graphical systems rely on complex interactions between applications, system services, and hardware. Akari proposes a new approach to managing these interactions, diverging from traditional monolithic or integrated display server architectures. It specifies a protocol designed around the principles of modularity, explicit state management, and clear separation of concerns.

This specification details the Akari protocol, defining the required components, their interactions, the communication methods, the object model, and the expected behaviors necessary to build a compliant Akari display system.

=== Terminology

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", 
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this 
document are to be interpreted as described in https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119[RFC 2119].

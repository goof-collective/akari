== Protocol Errors

Akari defines reserved status codes for some errors. Errors should only be returned on messages that specify `reply_to`.

|===

[[err-InvalidMessage]]
| *Invalid Message*
| Returned if a request message body, while structurally valid (passed verification), contained semantically invalid parameters or could not be processed as requested.
| `1`

[[err-Unauthorized]]
| *Unauthorized*
| Returned when the requesting client does not have permission to perform the requested action on the target object or resource.
| `2`

[[err-NotFound]]
| *Not Found*
| Returned when a referenced object or resource does not exist.
| `3`

[[err-Conflict]]
| *Conflict*

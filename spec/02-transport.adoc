== Transport Mechanism

Akari defines two primary mechanisms for communication between the Controller and clients: Unix Domain Sockets (UDS) for general message passing and shared memory buffers for time-sensitive bulk data transfer.

=== Unix Domain Sockets

The primary transport for Akari protocol messages MUST be UDS.

Clients establish a connection by connecting to a well-known UDS path created by the Controller upon startup. The mechanism for discovering this path is outside the scope of this protocol (e.g. environment variables, standard path).

Communication is bidirectional. Both the Controller and connected clients MAY send and receive messages asynchronously.

All messages transferred over UDS MUST be serialized using the *FlatBuffers* serialization library, conforming to the schemas defined in <<messages>>. Implementations MUST use the FlatBuffers Verifier on all received messages before processing (see <<message-verification>>).

File descriptor passing (for <<shared-memory-buffers>> and <<frame-synchronization, fences>>) MUST be performed using `SCM_RIGHTS` ancillary data over the UDS connection.

=== Shared Memory Buffers

For bulk data transfer requiring minimal latency and overhead (primarily graphical content), Akari defines shared memory buffers.

Implementations MUST support two types of shared memory buffers, corresponding to different use cases:

Data Buffers (`memfd`):: Anonymous memory file descriptors created using `memfd_create(2)`. These provide CPU-accessible shared memory suitable for general data sharing or software rendering.
DMA Buffers (`DMA-BUF`):: File descriptors representing buffers accessible via Direct Memory Access (DMA), typically managed by graphics or multimedia hardware drivers. These are essential for efficient zero-copy sharing of graphical buffers between applications, the Window Manager, and the GPU.

Roles::
  Producer::: The client that creates and owns the buffer, typically having exclusive write access.
  Consumer::: Any other client granted read-only access to the buffer.

The internal data layout or schema within a shared memory buffer is NOT defined by the Akari protocol itself. Consumers MUST interpret the buffer's content based on metadata provided separately (e.g., stored in the corresponding <<buffer, `Buffer` object>>).

Access to shared memory buffers, especially `DMA-BUF` used for rendering, requires synchronization. This MUST be handled using explicit synchronization primitives, primarily fence file descriptors passed via UDS. See <<frame-synchronization>>.
